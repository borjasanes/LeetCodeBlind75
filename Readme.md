# Blind75 LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to the famous "Blind 75" list of coding problems from LeetCode.

The Blind 75 is a list of 75 coding problems that are frequently asked in coding interviews. The list was compiled by a software engineer who received offers from several FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google) companies, and it's recommended for anyone preparing for a technical coding interview.

## Structure

Each problem has its own directory which contains the problem statement, my solution and a test class.

The directories are named as the problem titles on LeetCode, for ease of searching.

## How to Use

Feel free to browse these solutions for learning purposes.

## Progress

I'll be updating the repository as I continue to work through the list.
